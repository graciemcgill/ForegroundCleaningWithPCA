# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a Foreground Removal Technique for HI Intensity Mapping

This repository contains code written and adapted by Gracie McGill for the senior honours project titled above. 
This project aims to investigate the use of PCA as a foreground removal technique for cosmological HI insensity mapping. <br/>
